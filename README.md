AuDOMio
=======

Dynamically generates music by parsing the structure of web sites.  Audio generation done using [Audiolet.js](https://github.com/oampo/Audiolet) and [Music.js](https://github.com/gregjopa/music.js).

During playback, whichever nodes are being used to create a sound are given a random background and border color.
